Exoplanets - Using Data found on Kaggle.com, implemented Logistic Regression w/ Regularization 
to determine whether or not a star has an exoplanet or not. Accuracy is around ~50%, 
so my next step is to try it with a Neural Network. Done by myself

ExoPlanetsWithNN - Same Dataset as above, implemented with a Neural Network with 1 hidden layer,  
w/ L2 Regularization. Accuracy is 99.1%. However, the issue is mainly that in the dataset of 570
stars, only 5 have exoplanets in the Test set. Therefore my accuracy is so high because it predicts
all 570 stars do not have a planet :( - 565/570 = 99.1 (the accuracy). Done by myself.

I now view this as practice implementing Logistic Regression, a Neural Network, Regularization,
and testing Precision & Recall.
