Exoplanets - Using Data found on Kaggle.com, implemented Logistic Regression w/ Regularization 
to determine whether or not a star has an exoplanet or not. Accuracy is around ~50%, 
so my next step is to try it with a Neural Network.

ExoPlanetsWithNN - Same Dataset as above, implemented with a Neural Network with 1 hidden layer,  
w/ L2 Regularization. Accuracy is >97%. However, the issue is mainly that in the dataset of 570
stars, only 5 have exoplanets in the Test set. Therefore my accuracy is so high because it predicts
all 570 stars do not have a planet :(
