Hello, if you found this you're probably considering hiring me (or just stumbled upon this, either way hello). To make it as easy as possible here's a breakdown of the files:

-Cell Research : The overseeing professor gave me an algorithm to simulate a cancer cell's growth. This is my implementation of that algorithm in Java. (Second to last year of University)

-Coursera Machine Learning : Self-explanatory. Code in Matlab. Before each project is a pdf that highlights which files I edited & which ones were given. (Post graduation)

-Data Structres & Algorithms : UW CSE 373 course. In it are the projects we worked on. All of these projects were done as duo projects with the same partner throughout the quarter. Some of them even built on each other. For instance, one project was implementing a HashTable & a DoubleLinkedList that we would use in future projects. (Final year of University)

-Independent Projects: Stuff I did in my spare time. Includes ML projects, Unity projects, and random stuff. (Post graduation)

-Website: Independent project where I design a website in HTML & CSS, just basic stuff about me - hobbies, social media accounts, etc. (Post graduation)
