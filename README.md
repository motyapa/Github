These are files I've worked on throughout the years. Here you will find:

-Cell Research : The overseeing professor gave me an algorithm to simulate a cancer cell's growth. This is my implementation of that algorithm in Java. (Second to last year of University)

-Coursera Machine Learning : Self-explanatory. Code in Matlab. Before each project is a pdf that highlights which files I edited & which ones were given. (Post graduation)

-Data Structres & Algorithms : UW CSE 373 course. In it are the projects we worked on. (Final year of University)

-Independent Projects: Stuff I did in my spare time. (Post graduation)

-Website: Independent project where I design a website in HTML & CSS, just basic stuff about me - hobbies, social media accounts, etc. (Post graduation)
