Github 

These are files I've worked on throughout the years. Here you will find:

-Cell Research : The overseeing professor gave me an algorithm to simulate a cancer cell's growth. This is my implementation of that algorithm in Java.

-Coursera Machine Learning : Self-explanatory. Code in Matlab. Before each project is a pdf that highlights which files I edited & which ones were given.

-Data Structres & Algorithm : UW CSE 373 course. In it are the projects we worked on.
