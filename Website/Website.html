		<h2> Introduction: </h2>
		<p> I sincerely doubt anyone will read this, I'm just here practicing 
		HTML on my own. But, if this somehow ends up in the hands of another human-being
		then you'll learn a lot of useless facts about me.</p>

		<h2> Quick links: </h2>

		<p> A natural question to ask about anyone: "Are you good looking?" Well the answer 

		is <a href = "#selfie">Yes. Definitely Yes. </a></p>

		<p> You might be thinking, wow, you're so interesting - is there anyway I can learn more? Well don't fear,
		check out <a href = "#Social">my social media!</a></p>

		<p> At this point you must be thinking - attractive and smart? Let us hire you! Well you're in luck, 
		here's <a href = "#Resume">my resume </a></p>
